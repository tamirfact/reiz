# Reisinger's Perpetual Calendar

A digital interactive version of Dan Reisinger's perpetual calendar, originally commissioned by MoMA in 1987.

## PERPETUAL CALENDAR

In 1987, MoMA commissioned Dan Reisinger to create a perpetual calendar. Reisinger has created a vibrant and interactive calendar that empowered users to form up to 46,080 visually appealing combinations of color and form. The original design consisted of a durable metal frame holding six double-sided, colored cutout sheets and date cards. This digital interactive version builds upon Reisingerâ€™s concept, offering new ways to engage with his work that were unavailable in the original physical format.
